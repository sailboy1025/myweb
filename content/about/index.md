Welcome to my research profile! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Case Western Reserve University, working under the guidance of Prof. [Zonghe Chua](https://zonghe-chua.github.io/experience/) in [Lab ERIE](https://enhanced-telerobotics.github.io/team/). My research focuses on the intersection of haptics, teleoperation optimization, and enhanced eye tracking virtual reality (VR). In this page, I will provide an overview of my research interests and the goals I aim to achieve through my doctoral studies.

## Research Interests

1. **Haptics**: Haptics refers to the sense of touch and its integration into virtual environments. I am particularly interested in exploring how haptic feedback can be enhanced and integrated into various applications, such as surgical simulations, rehabilitation, and immersive VR experiences.

2. **Teleoperation Optimization**: Teleoperation involves controlling a remote system or robot from a distance. My research focuses on developing movement compensation techniques and algorithms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of teleoperation systems under delay circumstance. By addressing challenges such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and control stability, I aim to enhance the teleoperation experience across domains like robotics, healthcare, and hazardous environments.

3. **Enhanced Eye Tracking VR**: I am interested in exploring how eye tracking can be leveraged to enhance the user experience in clinic environments. By studying gaze behavior, attentional mechanisms, and user interfaces, I aim to develop novel techniques that improve surgeon overall performance.

## Objectives

Throughout my Ph.D. studies, I have set several objectives to guide my research and contribute to the field:

1. **Advancing Haptic Technology**: I strive to develop new algorithms, techniques, and hardware designs that advance the field of haptics. By improving the fidelity and realism of haptic feedback, I aim to enable more immersive and interactive experiences in virtual environments.

2. **Optimizing Teleoperation Systems**: Through optimization algorithms and system design, I aim to minimize the effects of latency, instability, and other challenges in teleoperation systems. By enhancing the teleoperation experience, I hope to enable safer, more efficient remote operations in various domains.

3. **Exploring Eye Tracking Applications**: By conducting user studies and designing novel VR interactions, I aim to unlock the potential of eye tracking technology in virtual reality. My goal is to develop new techniques that leverage eye tracking data to improve immersion, navigation, object manipulation, and user interfaces in VR environments.

4. **Contributing to Research Community**: I am committed to sharing my research findings through academic publications and presentations at conferences. By actively participating in the research community, I aim to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of haptics, teleoperation optimization, and enhanced eye tracking VR.
